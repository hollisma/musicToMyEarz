# ### Potential Issues:
# Changing keys into 0-1 columns may lead to underfitting, since there are more features and the same amount of data.
# 
# If a song is in a certain key, then there are 0's in all other columns of keys. In other words, the values of the columns of keys are dependent on the other such columns.
